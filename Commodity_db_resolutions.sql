Question: 3
In this problem, each commodity is available in numerous varieties. We need a table that shows all the commodities sorted 
in decreasing order of the number of varieties available. After finding this, the third commodity in this list is also asked 
for.

The following are the desired inputs and outputs:
Input: commodities_info: Commodity and Variety
Expected output: Commodity | Variety count; Sort in descending order of Variety count

Find out the state with the least number of entries, that is, where the company has minimum presence amongst all other states. 
Then, within that state, we have to find out the commodity with the highest number of data points available.
This question is one of the most commonly asked questions in business scenarios, as it helps in planning business outlooks.

The following are the inputs and outputs required as per the demand of the problem statement:
Input: price_details: Id, region_id, commodity_id region_info: Id and State commodities_info: Id and Commodity
Expected output: commodity;  Expecting only one value as output

The initial steps to be taken are as follows:
Step 1: Join region information and price details by using the Region_Id from price_details with Id from region_info.
Step 2: From the result of Step 1, perform aggregation â€“ COUNT(Id), group by State.
Step 3: Sort the result based on the record count computed in Step 2 in ascending order; Filter for the top State.
Step 4: Filter for the state identified from Step 3 from the price_details table.
